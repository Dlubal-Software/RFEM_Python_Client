Python client (or high-level functions) for [RFEM 6](https://www.dlubal.com/en/products/rfem-fea-software/what-is-rfem) using [Web Services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_service) (WS), [SOAP](https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOAP) and [WSDL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Services_Description_Language). Available Python SOAP pkgs can be found on [wiki.python.org](https://wiki.python.org/moin/WebServices#SOAP).

## Description
This Python project is focused on opening RFEM 6 to all our customers, enabling them to interact with RFEM on much higher level. If you are looking for tool to help you solve parametric models or optimization tasks, you are on the right place. This project and community will create support for all your projects. The goal is to create easily expandable Python library communicating instructions to RFEM through WS. WS enable you to access your local version of RFEM or remote via internet connection.

## Architecture

### Data Structure
* [main.py](main.py): setting of individual objects by one line entry
* [window.py](/RFEM/window.py): definition of GUI layer; called first
* [initModel.py](/RFEM/initModel.py): runs after window and initializes suds.Client by connecting to `http://localhost:8081/wsdl` and active model in RFEM
* [enums.py](/RFEM/enums.py): definition of enums
* [dataTypes.py](/RFEM/dataTypes.py): definition of special data types
* [RFEM](/RFEM): folder following structure of RFEM 6 navigator containing individual types of objects

## Getting started

### Dependencies
Dependency check is implemented inside [initModel.py](/RFEM/initModel.py) with option to install during execution.
* libraries: [SUDS](https://github.com/suds-community/suds), [requests](https://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/), and  [suds_requests](https://pypi.org/project/suds_requests/)
* RFEM 6 application

### Step by step
1) Clone this repository (if you have GitHub account) or download actual [release](https://github.com/Dlubal-Software/RFEM_Python_Client/releases/tag/R-v1.0.0)
2) Open RFEM 6 application
3) Check if there are no opened dialogues in RFEM and server port range under *Options-Web Services* corresponds to the one set in initModel
4) Update main.py and run from the same file

### Examples
Examples can be found under [Examples](/Examples) folder.
